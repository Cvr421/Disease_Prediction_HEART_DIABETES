# PREDICT DISEASE USING MACHINE LEARNING
We uses the Hundered of real Heart and Diabetes patient data to predict that patient have this disease or not using different Machine Learning Algorithm like Decision tree classifier ,Neural network and Super vector Machine(SVM) Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifier to process the data and find the accuracy of prediction. AI and ML technologies hold immense promise in the medical field, particularly for disease prediction and prevention. By leveraging advanced algorithms and vast amounts of healthcare data, these technologies empower healthcare professionals to make more accurate diagnoses, develop personalized treatment plans, and improve patient outcomes.

# Getting Started 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Python3
Node js version 18
React  version 18

```
### Fork the Repository
```
https://github.com/Cvr421/Disease_Prediction_HEART_DIABETES.git
```
### Clone the Repository from your github account 
```
https://github.com/your_user_name/Disease_Prediction_HEART_DIABETES.git
```
### Start the Python Server from root directory
### `Python3 Server.py`


## Start the Frontend 

In the project directory name frontend, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
